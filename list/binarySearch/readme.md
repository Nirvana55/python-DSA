#Binary search algorithm:

Binary search algorithm is a searching algorithm. In order to use the binary search algorithm the list should be sorted. It will repeatedly divide the list into half arr[high+low /2].
And if the number is more than mid, it will use mid + 1, else it will use mid - 1.

Its time complexity is O(logN).

Conditions for when to apply Binary Search in a Data Structure:
To apply Binary Search algorithm:

1. The data structure must be sorted.
2. Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time.

If the element is found in the middle the loop will be terminated.

#With that it will find the mid of the element by
