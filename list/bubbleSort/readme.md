Bubble Sort Algorithm:

It is a sorting algorithm. During the sorting process, we examine two elements at once. The largest element will be ordered directly to the end, therefore we should not worry about the last element when traversing the loop.

The algorithm's time complexity is 0(n^2).

In today's environment, many algorithms have been optimized. This algorithm is currently rarely used.
However, if optimized, we may utilize this approach.
