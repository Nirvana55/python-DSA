The Linked List:

A linked list is a collection of non-contiguous memory nodes. The Data and a pointer are stored in a linked list. The final element will have a reference to None.

-> Data: the value that is retained
-> The next node is indicated by a pointer.
-> None Last Element Pointer

A linked list consumes more memory than a list. However, it is used in data structures like as stacks and queues because, unlike queues and stacks, linked lists have a relatively low temporal complexity while adding and removing components. The linked list is followed by a module in Python collection.deque. It may also be used to analyze graphs in order to find the connection between nodes.

The Doubly linked list:

A DLL node has three fields: the data field, the previous link field, and the next link field. Because it has three fields, the DLL takes up more memory than the SLL. Because traversal can be done from the beginning or the end, the complexity of insertion and deletion at a given place is O(n / 2) = O(n). A doubly linked list can be used to execute heaps, stacks, and binary trees. When searching for a better solution, we prefer to employ a doubly linked list. It is more efficient to use a doubly linked list. When memory is not an issue and we require improved search efficiency, we utilize a doubly linked list.
