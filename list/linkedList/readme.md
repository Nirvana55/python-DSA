The Linked List:

A linked list is a collection of non-contiguous memory nodes. The Data and a pointer are stored in a linked list. The final element will have a reference to None.

-> Data: the value that is retained
-> The next node is indicated by a pointer.
-> None Last Element Pointer

A linked list consumes more memory than a list. However, it is used in data structures like as stacks and queues because, unlike queues and stacks, linked lists have a relatively low temporal complexity while adding and removing components. The linked list is followed by a module in Python collection.deque. It may also be used to analyze graphs in order to find the connection between nodes.
