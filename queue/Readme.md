Queue:
Queue is a linear data structure. Unlike stacks, it adheres to the FIFO (First in First Out) principle. It's like standing in line at a movie theater, and whomever is first will get the ticket. Similarly, the first person in line will always be removed.

Why queue?
Queue data structures are intended to handle scenarios in which things must be managed as they are introduced. As the name implies, we may use it to do tasks such as task management, task scheduling, data streaming, and job queues.
