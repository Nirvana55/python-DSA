Queue:
Queue is a linear data structure. Unlike stacks, it adheres to the FIFO (First in First Out) principle. It's like standing in line at a movie theater, and whomever is first will get the ticket. Similarly, the first person in line will always be removed.

Why queue?
Queue data structures are intended to handle scenarios in which things must be managed as they are introduced. As the name implies, we may use it to do tasks such as task management, task scheduling, data streaming, and job queues.

Queue has three types:

-> Circular Queue:
Circular queue is mostly used for memory management. Since queue go in fifo last element wont be clear. In case of circular queue if there is a queue on the last and if new queue is added it will add to the first element. It will add to the queue until it meets the running queue element. If it meets the running queue element it will display as "QUEUE IS FULL".

-> Priority Queue:
Priority queue as its name it sets priority to the queue. Queue with same priority will run as order.

-> Double Ended Queue:
Double ended queue is different from all above queue. It wont even follow the FIFO principle. In this data structure queue can be added and remove from both FRONT and REAR.
