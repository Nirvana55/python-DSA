Stack:

The stack data structure is based on the linear data structure. It follows to the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. LIFO just removes the most recently added item from its stack.
Consider a stack of dishes stacked on top of each other. And the plate that is kept on last is always removed.

Why should you stack?
On the DS (Data structure world), a stack has a specific purpose. Because of its LIFO characteristic, we can do tasks such as redo, store browser history and go back, event simulation, and many more. We can even see it on browsers that we use every day to maintain functions and their local variables.
